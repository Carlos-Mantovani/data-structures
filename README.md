# C data structures
This is a repository containing my implementations of the most common types of data structures you will learn in Computer Science.
There is a main.c file for each of the structures with an example of how to use them.

You should compile the c files into object files like that and then link them (using gcc):
```bash
gcc -c main.c -o main.o
gcc -c list.c -o list.o
gcc main.o list.o -o executable-file-name
```
